Code Structure

// Main calculation logic
const numberofCups = Number(prompt("How many cups of chai do you want to make?"));

// Ingredient measurements per cup
const waterperCup = 200;
const milkperCup = 50;
const TeaLeavesperCup = 1;
const sugarperCup = 2;

// Calculate totals
const totalWater = numberofCups * waterperCup;
const totalMilk = numberofCups * milkperCup;
const totalteaLeaves = numberofCups * TeaLeavesperCup;
const totalsugar = numberofCups * sugarperCup;

// Display results
console.log(`For ${numberofCups} cup(s) of chai you need:`);
// ... more output
